Implementation of Spatial Networks based on [RÃ©my Cabazet lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsGV_FHwhfY).

> This repository has two objectives:
>
> - learning about Spatial Networks
> - understanding how to create a Python package

## RoadMap

- [ ] Rewrite early code to integrate shapely
- [ ] Use releases so that automatic push is made to pypi

## TODO

- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add simpler drawing functions
- [ ] Better computations
- [ ] Add examples
- [ ] Find datasets
