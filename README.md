> This repository has two objectives:
>
> - learning about Spatial Networks
> - understanding how to create a Python package

If you want to see how this works, or at least where this is going, you can find a first notebook in the [notebooks](notebooks/01_basic_data_structures.ipynb) folder.

## RoadMap

- [x] Rewrite early code to integrate shapely
- [ ] Use releases so that automatic push is made to pypi

## TODO

- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add simpler drawing functions
- [ ] Better computations
- [ ] Add examples
- [ ] Find datasets
